# PythonCFA

Welcome to the Penang Science Cluster's Coding for All project page for Python (PythonCFA).

Here you will find course material and coding samples that can be used in your class if you are a teacher, or for self-studying if you are an independent learner.

All material contained within are freely available and redistributable under Mozilla Public License 2.0, with the exception of submodules and fonts we have attached to this repository which may fall under different open licenses.

# Contributing

We are focused on making sure the material is as bug-free and comprehensive as possible, and with your help we can keep the mistakes down to a minimum. The main introductory document is found in this repository at:

    /intro/docs/python_course.fodt

All pdf files are generated based on this fodt file.

To ensure consistency when editing, use a text editor like Kate (Linux) or Notepad (Windows) to make your changes if the edits are strictly text-based. If visual editing is preferred, ensure that all the fonts used in the text are installed on your system. These fonts are available to download via:

    /intro/docs/fonts

We are transitioning to the more visually-impaired friendly font Atkinson-Hyperlegible which is included in the submodule folder for reference. You can also download the font from:

    https://github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible.git

Fonts are embedded directly in the fodt files for convenience. However, if for some reason the version you have pulled does not contain the fonts, they can still be installed manually as mentioned.
    
LibreOffice Writer is the recommended visual editor for use with the fodt files within this repository. If another visual editor is used (e.g. Microsoft Word) ensure it supports the fodt file format and does not introduce incompatible changes to the original fodt files.

# Sponsors

We would like to thank our main sponsor, the Penang State Government for funding the work in this project to make learning to code more accessible to everyone.
